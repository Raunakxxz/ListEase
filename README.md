  * **Contextual Relevance:** Offers items frequently bought together or popular items in a specific category.
  * **Speedy Input:** **Autocomplete** suggestions appear as you type, dramatically reducing manual entry.

### 2\. 📝 Effortless List & Item Management

  * **Multiple Lists:** Users can create, name, and switch between various lists instantly (e.g., "Weekly Groceries," "Work Tasks").
  * **Quick Actions:** Simple tap or swipe to mark an item as **Purchased** or **Completed**.
  * **Item Reordering:** Features a smooth **drag-and-drop** interface to help organize lists by priority or store layout.

### 3\. ✨ Additional UX Enhancements

  * **Offline Mode:** Work on your lists anywhere, ensuring accessibility even without an internet connection.
  * **Search Functionality:** Quickly locate items across all your managed lists.
  * **Themes:** Supports both Light and Dark mode for comfortable use.
  * **Notifications:** Optional reminders for recurring purchases or tasks.
